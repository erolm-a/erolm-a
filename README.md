# Hello World

I am a computational neuroscience grad student at the University of Trento. Previously I was a research assistant at Glasgow University working on [SLIM](https://github.com/resistance-modelling/slim), a game theoretical/reinforcement learning approach applied to salmon parasite management. Before that, I was a [competitive programmer](https://github.com/erolm-a/competitive-programming) and have worked on NLP ([my dissertation project](https://github.com/erolm-a/colla-framework)).

Other SWE projectes I worked on involve [AR in Unity](https://github.com/erolm-a/obashi-dataflows), two game engines ([a general purpose, ECS'd, lua-scripted 3D game engine](https://github.com/BoydOrg/BoydEngine), and an older [2D game engine](https://github.com/erolm-a/2d-platformer) I wrote back in 2015). I won a scolarship for best student project after setting up a [leap-motion controlled robotic hand](https://github.com/erolm-a/inframove) in 2018. Haskell remains one of my favourite languages of all time, and led me to making a [skimpy library](https://github.com/erolm-a/haskell-lvalue) to show the power of GADTs in Haskell.

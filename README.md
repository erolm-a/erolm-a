I work in Computational Neuroscience, particularly on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

My past research works can be found [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5162-1059).

Another project that has just turned into a paper: [SLIM, a sea lice simulator with reinforcement learning](https://github.com/resistance-modelling/slim); extra mention to my [bachelor internship and research project](https://github.com/erolm-a/colla-framework)).

Non-research projects I worked on, in random order: [AR in Unity](https://github.com/erolm-a/obashi-dataflows); [a Lua-scriptable, ECS game engine](https://github.com/BoydOrg/BoydEngine); [a leap-motion controlled robotic hand](https://github.com/erolm-a/inframove); [a Haskell skimpy library to mimic C-style l-values](https://github.com/erolm-a/haskell-lvalue).

# Hello World

I am a CS student at the University of Glasgow.

Here is a small summary of my past experiences:

- *Competitive Programming*: some solution stubs [here](https://github.com/erolm-a/competitive-programming) (unmaintained since 2018)

- *NLP*. I worked on custom knowledge graphs with the aim of improving existing IR systems with (hopefully!) high-quality data. Currently working on my dissertation on logical reasoning with attention-based mechanisms. Also made a [joke repo](https://github.com/erolm-a/monty-python-flying-muppets).

- *Reinforcement Learning* in the context of automated decision making (see [my team coursework](https://github.com/erolm-a/ai-coursework-2020) (still private)).

- *Good old-fashioned Artificial Intelligence* [GOFAI](https://github.com/erolm-a/lts)

- *Game development*: I made an [AR application in Unity](https://github.com/erolm-a/obashi-dataflows), a [general purpose, ECS'd, lua-scripted 3D game engine](https://github.com/BoydOrg/BoydEngine), an older [2D game engine](https://github.com/erolm-a/2d-platformer) (README in Italian, beware!)

- *Web development*: I have written front-end code in VueJS for [medium-sized applications](https://github.com/denBot/NootTech)

- *Computer Vision and Robotics*: I am a member of UGR 2020 and am a contributor and advisor of the [driverless](https://gitlab.com/QuestioWo/ugrdv) team. I also made a [leap-motion driven robotic hand](https://github.com/erolm-a/inframove) with a laptop and an Arduino.

- *Functional Programming*: Made a [skimpy library](https://github.com/erolm-a/haskell-lvalue) to show the power of GADTs in Haskell. It is not properly packaged, I apologize.
